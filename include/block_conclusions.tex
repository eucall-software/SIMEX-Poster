  \begin{itemize}
    \item Diffraction data from hydrated proteins give estimate of tolerable
      water layer thickness
    \item[$\Rightarrow$] $R < 0.2$ criterion indicates that \SI{3}{\angstrom} thick water layer permits
      imaging at few \si{\angstrom} resolution.
    \item The coefficient of variation $\sigma_\text{V}(k) $
         quantifies the ``interpretability'' of simulated diffraction data under real--world conditions.
    \item Extremely short (\SI{3}{\femto\second}) XFEL pulses outrun radiation damage in
      single--protein imaging experiments at SPB--SFX.
    \item Lower pulse fluence at \SI{3}{\femto\second} yields
      low S/N and high $\sigma_\text{V}(k)$ in
      oriented 3D diffraction data.
    \item[$\Rightarrow$] Optimal pulse duration for small proteins closer to
      \SI{9}{\femto\second} despite radiation damage.
